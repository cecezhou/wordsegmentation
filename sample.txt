paid for sleeping together. This was the end of the 
trap. This was what people got for loving each other. 
Thank God for gas, anyway. What must it have been 
like before there were anaesthetics? Once it started, 
they were in the mill-race. Catherine had a good time 
in the time of pregnancy. It wasn't bad. She was 
hardly ever sick. She was not awfully uncomfortable 
until toward the last. So now they got her in the end. 
You never got away with anything. Get away hell! 
It would have been the same if we had been married 
fifty times. And what if she should die? She won't 
die. People don't die in childbirth nowadays. That 
was what all husbands thought. Yes, but what if she 
should die? She won't die. She's just having a bad 
time. The initial labor is usually protracted. She's 
only having a bad time. Afterward we'd say what a 
bad time and Catherine would say it wasn't really so 
bad. But what if she should die? She can't die. Yes, 
but what if she should die? She can't, I tell you. Don't 
be a fool. It's just a bad time. It's just nature giving her hell. It's only the first labor, which is almost 
always protracted. Yes, but what if she should die? 
She can't die. Why would she die? What reason is 
there for her to die? There's just a child that has to 
be born, the by-product of good nights in Milan. It 
makes trouble and is born and then you look after it 
and get fond of it maybe. But what if she should die? 
She won't die. But what if she should die? She 
won't. She's all right. But what if she should die? 
She can't die. But what if she should die? Hey, what 
about that? What if she should die?
